# Nutrition Fundamentals: Science-Based Guide to Healthy Eating

Nutrition doesn't have to be complicated. This guide covers the science-based fundamentals of healthy eating, debunks common myths, and provides practical strategies for lasting results.

## Core Principles

### Energy Balance

Weight management comes down to energy balance:

- **Weight Loss:** Calories In < Calories Out
- **Weight Maintenance:** Calories In = Calories Out
- **Weight Gain:** Calories In > Calories Out

But it's not just about calories—food quality, macros, and timing all play roles.

### Calorie Estimation

**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) - Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:**

Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

**Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):**

| Activity Level | Multiplier |
|----------------|------------|
| Sedentary | BMR × 1.2 |
| Lightly Active | BMR × 1.375 |
| Moderately Active | BMR × 1.55 |
| Very Active | BMR × 1.725 |
| Extremely Active | BMR × 1.9 |

## Macronutrients

### Protein

**Functions:**
- Muscle building and repair
- Enzyme and hormone production
- Immune function
- Satiety (keeps you full)

**Recommendations:**
| Goal | Daily Protein |
|------|---------------|
| Sedentary Adult | 0.36g per lb (0.8g/kg) |
| Active Adult | 0.5-0.7g per lb (1.2-1.6g/kg) |
| Muscle Building | 0.7-1g per lb (1.6-2.2g/kg) |
| Fat Loss | 0.8-1.2g per lb (1.8-2.7g/kg) |

**Best Sources:**
- Lean meats (chicken, turkey)
- Fish and seafood
- Eggs
- Greek yogurt
- Legumes and beans
- Tofu and tempeh
- Cottage cheese

### Carbohydrates

**Functions:**
- Primary energy source
- Brain fuel
- Muscle glycogen
- Fiber for digestion

**Types:**
- **Complex carbs:** Whole grains, vegetables, legumes (preferred)
- **Simple carbs:** Fruits, dairy, sugars

**Recommendations:**
- 45-65% of total calories (general population)
- Endurance athletes may need more
- Lower for sedentary individuals
- Focus on fiber-rich sources

**Best Sources:**
- Oats and whole grains
- Sweet potatoes
- Brown rice
- Quinoa
- Fruits
- Vegetables
- Legumes

### Fats

**Functions:**
- Hormone production
- Nutrient absorption (A, D, E, K)
- Brain health
- Cell membrane integrity

**Types:**
- **Saturated:** Limit to <10% of calories
- **Monounsaturated:** Emphasize (olive oil, avocado)
- **Polyunsaturated:** Include omega-3s and omega-6s
- **Trans fats:** Avoid completely

**Recommendations:**
- 20-35% of total calories
- Prioritize unsaturated sources
- Include omega-3 fatty acids

**Best Sources:**
- Olive oil
- Avocados
- Nuts and seeds
- Fatty fish (salmon, sardines)
- Eggs

## Micronutrients

### Key Vitamins

| Vitamin | Function | Sources |
|---------|----------|---------|
| A | Vision, immunity | Carrots, sweet potato, eggs |
| C | Immunity, antioxidant | Citrus, peppers, berries |
| D | Bone health, immunity | Sun, fish, fortified foods |
| E | Antioxidant | Nuts, seeds, oils |
| K | Blood clotting, bones | Leafy greens, fermented foods |
| B12 | Energy, nerves | Animal products, fortified foods |

### Key Minerals

| Mineral | Function | Sources |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Iron | Oxygen transport | Red meat, spinach, legumes |
| Calcium | Bones, muscles | Dairy, leafy greens, fortified |
| Magnesium | 300+ reactions | Nuts, seeds, leafy greens |
| Zinc | Immunity, healing | Meat, shellfish, legumes |
| Potassium | Heart, muscles | Bananas, potatoes, leafy greens |

### Getting Micronutrients from Food

**Eat the rainbow:**
- **Red:** Tomatoes, peppers, strawberries
- **Orange:** Carrots, sweet potato, oranges
- **Yellow:** Bananas, squash, corn
- **Green:** Spinach, broccoli, kale
- **Blue/Purple:** Blueberries, eggplant, grapes
- **White:** Garlic, onions, cauliflower

## Hydration

### Daily Water Needs

**General guideline:** 
- Half your body weight (lbs) in ounces
- Or 30-35ml per kg body weight
- More for active individuals and hot climates

**Signs of dehydration:**
- Dark yellow urine
- Thirst
- Fatigue
- Headaches
- Decreased performance

### Hydration Tips

- Start morning with water
- Drink before feeling thirsty
- Carry water bottle
- Eat water-rich foods
- Monitor urine color (pale yellow = good)

## Meal Timing and Frequency

### Does Meal Timing Matter?

For most people, **total daily intake** matters more than timing.

**When timing helps:**
- Pre/post workout nutrition for athletes
- Eating earlier may slightly benefit metabolic health
- Consistent meal times help hunger regulation

### Intermittent Fasting

**Common Protocols:**
- 16:8 (16 hour fast, 8 hour eating window)
- 5:2 (5 normal days, 2 low-calorie days)
- 24-hour fasts (occasional)

**Benefits:**
- Simplifies eating schedule
- May improve insulin sensitivity
- Easier calorie control for some

**Not magic:** Benefits come from calorie control, not the fasting itself.

## Building a Healthy Plate

### The Plate Method

- **½ plate:** Non-starchy vegetables
- **¼ plate:** Lean protein
- **¼ plate:** Complex carbohydrates
- **Add:** Healthy fats

### Sample Day of Eating

**Breakfast (400 cal):**
- 2 eggs scrambled
- 1 slice whole grain toast
- ½ avocado
- Handful spinach

**Lunch (500 cal):**
- Grilled chicken breast (5oz)
- Large mixed salad
- Olive oil dressing
- Quinoa (½ cup)

**Snack (200 cal):**
- Greek yogurt
- Handful of berries
- Small handful almonds

**Dinner (600 cal):**
- Salmon fillet (5oz)
- Roasted vegetables
- Sweet potato
- Side salad

**Total: ~1,700 calories**
- Protein: 120g
- Carbs: 150g
- Fat: 65g

## Weight Loss Strategies

### Creating a Calorie Deficit

**Sustainable deficit:** 300-500 calories below TDEE
- Larger deficits = more muscle loss, less sustainable
- Aim for 0.5-1% body weight loss per week

### Practical Tips

1. **Eat more protein** - Increases satiety
2. **Fill up on vegetables** - Low calorie, high volume
3. **Limit liquid calories** - Easy to overconsume
4. **Eat slowly** - 20 minutes for fullness signal
5. **Pre-portion snacks** - Avoid mindless eating
6. **Cook at home** - Control ingredients
7. **Plan ahead** - Prep meals weekly

### Tracking Options

**Detailed tracking:**
- MyFitnessPal, Cronometer
- Weigh and log all foods
- Useful for learning portions

**Simple tracking:**
- Hand portion method
- Plate method
- Less precise but more sustainable

**Hand Portion Guide:**
- Palm = Protein serving
- Fist = Vegetables
- Cupped hand = Carbs
- Thumb = Fats

## Common Nutrition Myths

### Myth 1: Carbs Make You Fat
**Truth:** Excess calories make you fat. Carbs are an important energy source.

### Myth 2: Eating Fat Makes You Fat
**Truth:** Dietary fat is essential. Excess calories from any source cause weight gain.

### Myth 3: You Need to Eat Every 3 Hours
**Truth:** Meal frequency doesn't significantly impact metabolism. Total intake matters.

### Myth 4: Breakfast is Essential
**Truth:** Breakfast is optional. Total daily intake matters more than timing.

### Myth 5: Clean Eating = Weight Loss
**Truth:** You can gain weight eating "clean" foods if you eat too many calories.

### Myth 6: Detox Diets Work
**Truth:** Your liver and kidneys handle detoxification. No special diet needed.

## Special Considerations

### Vegetarian/Vegan

**Key nutrients to monitor:**
- B12 (supplement required for vegans)
- Iron (pair with vitamin C)
- Calcium
- Omega-3s (algae-based supplements)
- Zinc

**Protein sources:**
- Legumes and beans
- Tofu and tempeh
- Seitan
- Quinoa
- Nuts and seeds

### Athletes

**Higher needs:**
- More protein (1.6-2.2g/kg)
- More carbohydrates
- Strategic nutrient timing
- Higher calories overall

**Pre-workout (1-2 hours before):**
- Easy-to-digest carbs
- Moderate protein
- Low fat

**Post-workout (within 2 hours):**
- 20-40g protein
- Carbs to replenish glycogen

### Aging Adults

**Considerations:**
- Higher protein needs
- Vitamin D and B12 often low
- Calcium for bone health
- Hydration awareness decreases

## Making It Sustainable

### Flexible Dieting (80/20)

- 80% whole, nutrient-dense foods
- 20% flexible choices
- No foods completely off-limits
- Reduces binge-restrict cycles

### Mindful Eating

- Eat without distractions
- Chew thoroughly
- Notice hunger and fullness cues
- Enjoy the experience

### Long-Term Success Tips

1. Make gradual changes
2. Focus on habits, not outcomes
3. Allow occasional indulgences
4. Don't aim for perfection
5. Find foods you actually enjoy
6. Make healthy eating convenient

## Conclusion

Healthy eating doesn't require perfection or restriction. Focus on whole foods, adequate protein, plenty of vegetables, and a sustainable approach that fits your lifestyle.

Key takeaways:
- Eat mostly whole, minimally processed foods
- Prioritize protein and vegetables
- Stay hydrated
- Find sustainable habits over quick fixes
