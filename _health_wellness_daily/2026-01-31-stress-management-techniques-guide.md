# Effective Stress Management Techniques: Complete 2026 Guide

Chronic stress is a silent epidemic affecting millions worldwide. This guide covers proven techniques to manage stress, build resilience, and improve your overall quality of life.

## Understanding Stress

### Types of Stress

**Acute Stress**
- Short-term response to immediate challenges

- Body returns to baseline after threat passes

**Chronic Stress**

When stressed, your body:
1. Releases cortisol and adrenaline
2. Increases heart rate and blood pressure
