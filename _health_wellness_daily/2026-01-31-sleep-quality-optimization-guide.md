# How to Optimize Your Sleep Quality: Science-Based Guide for 2026

Quality sleep is the foundation of good health. This comprehensive guide covers evidence-based strategies to help you fall asleep faster, sleep deeper, and wake up energized.

## Why Sleep Quality Matters

Poor sleep affects every aspect of health:

- **Cognitive function** - Memory, focus, and decision-making decline
- **Physical health** - Increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity
- **Mental health** - Higher rates of anxiety and depression
- **Immune function** - More susceptible to illness
- **Longevity** - Consistent poor sleep shortens lifespan

## Understanding Sleep Architecture

### Sleep Stages

A complete sleep cycle (90-110 minutes) includes:

1. **Stage 1 (N1)** - Light sleep, transition phase (5%)
2. **Stage 2 (N2)** - Body temperature drops, heart rate slows (45%)
3. **Stage 3 (N3)** - Deep sleep, physical restoration (25%)
4. **REM** - Dreams, memory consolidation (25%)

### Optimal Sleep Duration by Age

| Age Group | Recommended Hours |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Adults (26-64) | 7-9 hours |
| Young Adults (18-25) | 7-9 hours |
| Older Adults (65+) | 7-8 hours |

## Sleep Environment Optimization

### Temperature

**Optimal bedroom temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C)**

- Core body temperature naturally drops during sleep
- Cooler environments facilitate this process
- Use breathable bedding materials
- Consider a cooling mattress pad

### Light

**Goal: Complete darkness**

- Use blackout curtains or blinds
- Cover LED lights on electronics
- Remove or dim alarm clock displays
- Consider a sleep mask for travel

### Sound

**Goal: Consistent, quiet environment**

- White noise machines mask disruptive sounds
- Earplugs for noisy environments
- Keep bedroom away from street noise
- Consider soundproofing if needed

### Air Quality

- Keep humidity between 30-50%
- Use air purifier with HEPA filter
- Open windows when possible
- Avoid strong fragrances

## Pre-Sleep Routine

### 3-2-1 Rule

- **3 hours before bed** - No more food or alcohol
- **2 hours before bed** - No more work
- **1 hour before bed** - No more screens

### Wind-Down Activities

**Recommended:**
