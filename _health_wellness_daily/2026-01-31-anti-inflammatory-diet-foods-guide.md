# Anti-Inflammatory Diet: Complete Guide to Foods That Fight Inflammation

Chronic inflammation is linked to nearly every major disease, from heart disease and diabetes to cancer and Alzheimer's. The good news? Your diet is one of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about eating to reduce inflammation.

## Understanding Inflammation

### Acute vs. Chronic Inflammation

**Acute inflammation** is your body's natural healing response:
- Cuts and wounds
- Infections
- Short-term, protective
- Signs: redness, swelling, heat, pain

- Low-grade, persistent
- Often symptom-free
- Damages tissues over time
- Linked to most chronic diseases

### Causes of Chronic Inflammation

- Poor diet (processed foods, sugar, seed oils)

- Chronic stress
- Poor sleep
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Environmental toxins
- Gut dysbiosis

- Avoid artificial sweeteners
- Limit alcohol
- Manage stress

### Food Sensitivities

**Common inflammatory triggers:**
- Gluten (for some people)
- Dairy (for some people)
- Nightshades (for some people)
- Eggs (for some people)

**How to identify:**
1. Elimination diet (remove suspect foods 3-4 weeks)
2. Reintroduce one at a time
3. Track symptoms
4. Work with healthcare provider

## Lifestyle Factors That Reduce Inflammation

### Beyond Diet

**Sleep:**
- 7-9 hours per night
- Poor sleep increases inflammation significantly

**Exercise:**
- Regular moderate exercise is anti-inflammatory
- Don't overtrain (causes inflammation)

**Stress management:**
- Chronic stress = chronic inflammation
- Meditation, breathwork, nature

**Fasting:**
- Time-restricted eating
- Reduces inflammatory markers
- Improves autophagy

## Measuring Inflammation

### Blood Tests to Request

- **hs-CRP** (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein): Most important
- **ESR** (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)
- **Homocysteine**
- **Fasting insulin**
- **Fibrinogen**
- **IL-6** (less common, more specific)

### Optimal Levels

| Marker | Optimal Range |
|--------|---------------|
| hs-CRP | Under 1.0 mg/L |
| ESR | Under 20 mm/hr |
| Homocysteine | Under 10 µmol/L |
| Fasting insulin | 2-5 µIU/mL |
