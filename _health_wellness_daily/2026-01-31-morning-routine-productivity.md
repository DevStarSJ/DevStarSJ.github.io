# Morning Routine for Productivity: Science-Backed Habits for Success

How you start your morning sets the tone for your entire day. A well-designed morning routine can boost energy, enhance focus, and increase productivity. This guide shows you how to create one that works.

## Why Morning Routines Matter

### The Science of Mornings

**Cortisol awakening response:**
- Cortisol peaks 30-45 minutes after waking
- Natural energy boost for the day
- Best time for challenging tasks

**Willpower is finite:**
- Decision-making depletes willpower
- Mornings = highest willpower reserves
- Automate morning decisions

### Benefits of a Morning Routine

1. **Reduced stress** - No rushed mornings
2. **Better focus** - Mind is fresh
3. **Increased productivity** - Win the morning, win the day
4. **Improved mood** - Self-care before demands

## Building Your Morning Routine

### Step 1: Determine Wake Time

**Night before preparation:**
