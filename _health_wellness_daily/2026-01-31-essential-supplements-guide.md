# Essential Supplements Guide: What Actually Works in 2026

The supplement industry is worth billions, but which supplements actually work? This evidence-based guide covers the supplements backed by science, optimal dosages, and what to skip.

## Before You Start

### Important Principles

1. **Food first** - Supplements complement, not replace, a healthy diet
2. **Test, don't guess** - Get blood work to identify deficiencies
3. **Quality matters** - Choose third-party tested products
4. **Less is more** - Only take what you actually need
5. **Consult professionals** - Discuss with healthcare provider

### Third-Party Testing Certifications

Look for these on supplement labels:
- NSF International
- USP (United States Pharmacopeia)
- ConsumerLab
- Informed Sport (for athletes)
