## Progressive Overload: The Key to Growth

**What is Progressive Overload?**
Gradually increasing demands on your muscles to force adaptation.

**Methods:**
1. **Add Weight**: Increase load by 2.5-5 lbs
2. **Add Reps**: Do more repetitions
3. **Add Sets**: Increase volume
4. **Decrease Rest**: More density
5. **Improve Form**: Better muscle engagement

**Tracking Progress:**
- Keep a workout log
- Record weights, sets, reps
- Note how exercises feel
- Track body measurements monthly

## Nutrition for Muscle Building

### Protein Requirements
- Beginners: 0.7-1g per pound of body weight
- Example: 150 lb person = 105-150g protein daily

### Meal Timing
- Protein every 3-4 hours
- Post-workout: 20-40g protein within 2 hours
- Pre-bed: Casein or slow-digesting protein

### Caloric Needs
- **Build muscle**: Slight caloric surplus (+200-300 calories)
- **Lose fat while building**: Eat at maintenance
- **Cut fat**: Slight deficit (-300-500 calories)

## Recovery and Rest

### Sleep
- Aim for 7-9 hours
- Growth hormone releases during deep sleep
- Poor sleep = poor recovery

### Rest Days
- 48 hours between training same muscle group
- Active recovery: walking, stretching
- Listen to your body

### Signs of Overtraining
- Persistent fatigue
- Decreased performance
- Mood changes
- Increased injuries
- Poor sleep

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Ego Lifting**: Using too much weight with poor form
2. **Skipping Warm-ups**: Increases injury risk
3. **Neglecting Legs**: Don't skip leg day!
4. **Program Hopping**: Stick to a program for 8-12 weeks
5. **Not Eating Enough**: Muscle needs fuel
6. **Ignoring Recovery**: Growth happens during rest

## Sample Weekly Schedule

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Workout A |
| Tuesday | Cardio/Rest |
| Wednesday | Workout B |
| Thursday | Rest/Mobility |
| Friday | Workout A |
| Saturday | Cardio/Active Recovery |
| Sunday | Complete Rest |

## When to Progress

Move to intermediate programming when you can:
- Squat your body weight
- Bench press 75% of body weight
- Deadlift 1.25x body weight
- Complete 10+ proper push-ups
- Do 3+ pull-ups

## Conclusion

Strength training is a journey, not a destination. Start with the fundamentals, focus on proper form, and progressively challenge yourself. Consistency beats perfection—show up, put in the work, and results will follow.
