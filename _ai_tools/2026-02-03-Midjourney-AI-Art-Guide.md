## Mastering Prompts

### Basic Prompt Structure

```
[Subject] [Environment] [Style] [Parameters]
```

**Example:**
```
/imagine a majestic dragon perched on a cliff, 
overlooking a misty valley at sunset, 
fantasy art style, cinematic lighting --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### Essential Parameters

| Parameter | Function | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `--ar` | Aspect ratio | `--ar 16:9` |
| `--v` | Version | `--v 6` |
| `--q` | Quality | `--q 2` |
| `--s` | Stylize | `--s 750` |
| `--c` | Chaos | `--c 50` |
| `--no` | Negative prompt | `--no text` |
| `--seed` | Reproducibility | `--seed 12345` |

### Aspect Ratios for Different Uses

- **Instagram Post**: `--ar 1:1`

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Style References (--sref)

Upload an image to guide the aesthetic:
```
/imagine cyberpunk cityscape --sref [image_url] --sw 100
```

The `--sw` (style weight) ranges from 0-1000, with higher values following the reference more closely.

### 2. Character References (--cref)

Maintain consistent characters:
```
/imagine portrait of the woman reading a book --cref [character_url] --cw 100
```

### 3. Multi-Prompting

Use `::` to weight different elements:
```
/imagine sunset::2 ocean::1 peaceful --ar 16:9
```

Higher weights (2) give more emphasis to that element.

### 4. Permutation Prompts

Generate variations efficiently:
```
/imagine a {red, blue, green} sports car --ar 16:9
```

Creates three separate images with different colors.

## Prompt Formulas That Work

### Photorealistic Portraits

```
portrait of [subject], professional photography, 
soft studio lighting, shallow depth of field, 
shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens --ar 2:3 --v 6
```

### Fantasy Landscapes

```
[scene description], fantasy art, matte painting, 
volumetric lighting, epic scale, detailed environment,
trending on artstation --ar 21:9 --s 750
```

### Product Photography

```
[product] on minimalist background, 
commercial photography, soft shadows, 
professional lighting setup, high-end advertising 
--ar 1:1 --v 6
```

### Anime/Illustration Style

```
[subject] in anime style, detailed illustration, 
vibrant colors, dynamic pose, 
by studio ghibli --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

## Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific with Details

**Instead of:** "a house"
**Write:** "a Victorian mansion with ornate trim, wrap-around porch, overgrown garden, morning fog, moody atmosphere"

### 2. Reference Artists and Styles

- "in the style of Studio Ghibli"
- "Wes Anderson color palette"
- "rendered like a Pixar movie"
- "Greg Rutkowski digital painting"

### 3. Control Lighting

- "golden hour lighting"
- "dramatic rim lighting"
- "soft diffused light"
- "neon glow"
- "volumetric fog with light rays"

### 4. Use Camera Terminology

- "wide angle shot"
- "macro photography"
- "tilt-shift"
- "bird's eye view"
- "low angle dramatic shot"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overly complex prompts**: Keep it focused
2. **Conflicting styles**: Don't mix photorealistic with cartoon
3. **Ignoring aspect ratio**: Match to your intended use
4. **Skipping iterations**: Always run variations
5. **Not using negative prompts**: `--no` helps remove unwanted elements
