- **Conciseness** — Cut unnecessary words
- **Tone detection** — Formal? Casual? Confident?

### The New AI Features

- **GrammarlyGO** — Generate text from prompts
- **Full paragraph rewrites** — One click transformation
- **Tone adjustment** — Make it more friendly/professional
- **Length adjustment** — Shorten or expand
- **Brainstorming** — Generate ideas and outlines

## Grammarly Plans Compared

## Where Grammarly Shines

### 1. Email Writing

This is Grammarly's killer use case. Writing emails all day? Grammarly sits in your browser and:

- Catches typos before you hit send
- Suggests tone adjustments ("This sounds harsh, try...")
- Helps non-native speakers sound natural
- Generates quick replies with GrammarlyGO

### 2. Professional Documents

For reports, proposals, and business writing, Grammarly's formal tone suggestions are invaluable. It catches:

- Passive voice overuse
- Hedging language ("I think maybe perhaps...")
- Jargon that confuses readers
- Inconsistent terminology

### 3. Non-Native English Writers

This is huge. Grammarly understands common mistakes from different language backgrounds and provides targeted corrections. It's like having a native English editor on call 24/7.

## Grammarly vs ChatGPT for Writing

|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Integration** | Everywhere (browser, apps) | Separate window |
| **Real-time editing** | ✅ Inline | ❌ Copy-paste |
| **Grammar focus** | ✅ Deep | Basic |
| **Generation quality** | Good | Excellent |
| **Learning your style** | ✅ Yes | Per session |
| **Price** | $12/mo | $20/mo |

**The verdict:** They're complementary, not competitors.

- Use **ChatGPT** to draft and brainstorm
- Use **Grammarly** to polish and perfect

## Pro Tips for Power Users

### 1. Set Your Goals

Grammarly lets you set goals for each document:
- Audience (General, Knowledgeable, Expert)
- Formality (Informal to Formal)
- Domain (Academic, Business, Technical, etc.)
- Intent (Inform, Describe, Convince, Tell a Story)

These dramatically improve suggestions.

### 2. Personal Dictionary

Add industry terms, names, and brand words to avoid false corrections:
- Settings → Account → Personal Dictionary

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + G` — Open Grammarly
- Navigate suggestions with arrow keys
- `Enter` to accept, `Esc` to dismiss

### 4. Use the Desktop App

The Grammarly desktop app works everywhere — even in apps without browser extensions. Write in Notion, Slack, or any app with Grammarly checking.

## When NOT to Use Grammarly

- **Creative writing** — It can flatten your unique voice
- **Technical documentation** — Too many false positives on code/jargon
- **Casual texting** — Overthinks informal messages
- **Poetry** — It doesn't understand intentional rule-breaking

## Is Premium Worth It?

**Yes, if:**
- You write professionally every day
- English isn't your first language
- You send lots of important emails
- You need plagiarism checking
- Your writing impacts your career/business

**No, if:**
- You write occasionally
- You're already a strong writer
- You mainly write code or technical docs
- You prefer ChatGPT for generation

## The Bottom Line

Grammarly in 2026 is no longer just a grammar checker. It's a **writing confidence tool**. The AI features are good (not ChatGPT-level, but convenient), and the core grammar/style checking is still the best in class.

The real value? **Catching mistakes you'd miss** and **polishing your writing effortlessly**. That's worth $12/month for anyone who writes professionally.
