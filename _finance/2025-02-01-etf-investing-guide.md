## What is an ETF?

An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, bonds, or a mixture of investment types.

## Why Invest in ETFs?

### 1. Diversification
A single ETF can provide exposure to hundreds or thousands of stocks, reducing the risk associated with individual stock picking.

### 2. Low Costs
ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds, meaning more of your money stays invested.

### 3. Flexibility
Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.

### 4. Transparency
Most ETFs disclose their holdings daily, so you always know exactly what you own.

## Popular Types of ETFs

### Index ETFs
Track major indices like the S&P 500 (SPY, VOO) or total stock market (VTI).

### Sector ETFs
Focus on specific industries like technology (XLK), healthcare (XLV), or energy (XLE).

### Bond ETFs
Provide fixed-income exposure through government (TLT) or corporate bonds (LQD).

### International ETFs
Access global markets through developed (VEA) or emerging market (VWO) funds.

## Building Your ETF Portfolio

### The Core-Satellite Approach

**Core (70-80%):** Low-cost, broad market ETFs
- VTI (Total US Stock Market)
- VXUS (Total International Stock)
- BND (Total Bond Market)

**Satellite (20-30%):** Targeted exposure
- Sector ETFs for specific bets
- Thematic ETFs (clean energy, AI, etc.)

### Asset Allocation by Age

A common rule of thumb: subtract your age from 110 to determine your stock allocation.

| Age | Stocks | Bonds |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 25  | 85%    | 15%   |
| 40  | 70%    | 30%   |
| 55  | 55%    | 45%   |

## Getting Started

1. **Open a brokerage account** with low or no trading fees
2. **Decide on your allocation** based on risk tolerance and time horizon
3. **Start with broad market ETFs** before adding complexity
4. **Set up automatic investments** to build wealth consistently
5. **Rebalance annually** to maintain your target allocation

## Conclusion

ETF investing offers an accessible, cost-effective way to build long-term wealth. By starting with a simple, diversified portfolio and staying consistent with your contributions, you can achieve your financial goals without the complexity of individual stock picking.
