## The 4% Rule Explained

The **4% rule** is the most widely used retirement planning guideline. It states you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio annually with minimal risk of running out over 30 years.

### Your Retirement Number Formula

```
Annual Expenses × 25 = Retirement Number
```

**Examples:**
- $40,000/year expenses → $1,000,000 needed
- $60,000/year expenses → $1,500,000 needed
- $80,000/year expenses → $2,000,000 needed
- $100,000/year expenses → $2,500,000 needed

## Factors That Affect Your Number

### 1. Lifestyle Expectations

Your retirement lifestyle dramatically impacts your number:

| Lifestyle | Monthly Expenses | Annual | 25x Target |
|-----------|------------------|--------|------------|
| Frugal | $2,500 | $30,000 | $750,000 |
| Moderate | $4,000 | $48,000 | $1,200,000 |
| Comfortable | $6,000 | $72,000 | $1,800,000 |
| Luxurious | $10,000 | $120,000 | $3,000,000 |

### 2. Healthcare Costs

Healthcare is often the most underestimated retirement expense:
- Average couple retiring at 65: **$315,000** in healthcare costs
- Consider long-term care insurance
- Factor in Medicare premiums and gaps

### 3. Inflation

$1 million today ≠ $1 million in 30 years

At 3% annual inflation:
- $50,000 today = $121,000 in 30 years (same purchasing power)
- Your retirement number must grow too

### 4. Social Security & Pension

Don't forget other income sources:
- **Social Security**: Average benefit ~$1,900/month
- **Pension**: If you have one, factor it in
- **Part-time work**: Many retirees work part-time by choice

## Calculate Your Personal Retirement Number

### Step 1: Estimate Annual Expenses

Current monthly expenses: $_____
Minus work-related costs: $_____
Plus healthcare increase: $_____
Plus travel/hobbies: $_____
**= Retirement monthly expenses: $_____**

Annual = Monthly × 12

### Step 2: Factor in Other Income

Annual expenses: $_____
Minus Social Security: $_____
Minus Pension: $_____
**= Amount portfolio must cover: $_____**

### Step 3: Apply the 25x Rule

Amount portfolio must cover × 25 = **Your retirement number**

## The FIRE Movement Approach

**FIRE** (Financial Independence, Retire Early) uses similar math but with aggressive savings:

| FIRE Type | Savings Rate | Retirement Timeline |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Regular FIRE | 50% | 15-17 years |
| Lean FIRE | 60-70% | 10-12 years |
| Fat FIRE | 40-50% | 20+ years (bigger target) |
| Barista FIRE | 40% | Part-time work supplements |

## Common Retirement Planning Mistakes

### 1. Starting Too Late

**The cost of waiting:**

Starting at 25 with $500/month at 7%:
- At 65: **$1,200,000**

Starting at 35 with $500/month at 7%:
- At 65: **$567,000** (half!)

### 2. Being Too Conservative

Keeping everything in savings accounts earning 2% means losing to inflation. A balanced portfolio is essential.

### 3. Forgetting About Taxes

Traditional 401(k) withdrawals are taxed as income. Plan for:
- Tax-diversified accounts (Traditional + Roth)
- Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies
- State tax implications

### 4. Underestimating Longevity

Planning for 30 years? Consider:
- Average 65-year-old man lives to 84
- Average 65-year-old woman lives to 87
- **Plan for 30+ years** to be safe

## Action Plan: Start Today

### In Your 20s-30s
- Max out employer 401(k) match (free money!)
- Open a Roth IRA ($7,000/year limit)
- Target 15-20% savings rate
- Focus on growth investments

### In Your 40s
- Maximize all retirement accounts
- Calculate your actual retirement number
- Consider catch-up contributions after 50
- Review asset allocation

### In Your 50s-60s
- Shift toward more conservative allocation
- Plan Social Security timing strategy
- Create a withdrawal strategy
- Consider healthcare options

## Tools to Help You Plan

1. **Retirement calculators**: Fidelity, Vanguard, NerdWallet
2. **Social Security estimator**: ssa.gov
3. **Healthcare cost estimator**: AARP Health Costs Calculator
4. **Comprehensive planning**: NewRetirement, Empower

## The Bottom Line

Your retirement number depends on:
- **Lifestyle expectations**
- **Healthcare needs**
- **Other income sources**
- **Risk tolerance**

For most people, **$1-2 million** provides a comfortable retirement. But your number is personal—calculate it based on YOUR life.

**Start today.** Every year you wait costs you significantly due to lost compound growth. Even small contributions now make a huge difference later.
