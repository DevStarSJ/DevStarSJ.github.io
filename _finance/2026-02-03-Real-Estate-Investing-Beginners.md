## Why Invest in Real Estate?

### 1. Multiple Income Streams
- **Cash flow:** Monthly rental income
- **Appreciation:** Property value increases over time
- **Equity buildup:** Tenants pay down your mortgage
- **Tax benefits:** Depreciation, deductions, 1031 exchanges

### 2. Inflation Hedge
Real estate values and rents typically rise with inflation, protecting your purchasing power.

### 3. Leverage
You can control a $500,000 asset with a $100,000 down payment. Try that with stocks!

### 4. Tangible Asset
Unlike stocks, you can see, touch, and improve your investment.

## Real Estate Investing Methods

### 1. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

**Best for:** Total beginners, small investors, hands-off approach

REITs are companies that own income-producing real estate. You buy shares like stocks.

**How to invest:**
- Through brokerage account
- As low as $1 (fractional shares)
- Publicly traded on stock exchanges

**Types of REITs:**
- Residential (apartments)
- Commercial (offices, retail)
- Industrial (warehouses)
- Healthcare (hospitals, senior living)
- Specialty (data centers, cell towers)

**Popular REITs:**
- VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF)
- SCHH (Schwab U.S. REIT ETF)
- O (Realty Income - monthly dividends)

**Pros:**
- Liquid (sell anytime)
- No property management
- Diversification
- Low minimum investment
- Required to pay 90% of income as dividends

**Cons:**
- Less control
- Stock market volatility
- Taxed as ordinary income

### 2. Rental Properties

**Best for:** Active investors wanting maximum returns and control

Buy property, rent it out, and collect monthly income.

**Getting started:**
- Save 20-25% down payment (avoid PMI)
- Get pre-approved for investment property loan
- Research markets (job growth, population growth, rent-to-price ratio)
- Analyze deals (1% rule, cash-on-cash return)

**The 1% Rule:**
Monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price.
- $200,000 property → $2,000/month rent minimum

**Cash-on-Cash Return:**
Annual cash flow ÷ Total cash invested = Return
- Goal: 8-12% cash-on-cash return

**Expenses to budget:**
- Mortgage (principal + interest)
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Property management (8-10%)
- Maintenance (1-2% of value annually)
- Vacancy (5-8%)
- Capital expenditures (roof, HVAC, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Full control
- Tax benefits (depreciation)
- Build equity
- Force appreciation through improvements

**Cons:**
- Active management required
- Large capital needed
- Tenant issues
- Market risk

### 3. House Hacking

**Best for:** Young investors, first-time buyers

Live in one unit of a multi-family property and rent out the others.

**Examples:**
- Buy duplex, live in one unit, rent the other
- Buy house with basement apartment
- Rent out extra bedrooms

**Benefits:**
- Owner-occupied financing (3-5% down)
- Lower interest rates
- Learn landlording while living there
- Build equity while reducing housing costs

**Ideal scenario:**
- Buy 4-plex for $400,000
- Live in one unit
- 3 units rent for $1,200 each = $3,600/month
- Your mortgage: $2,800/month
- You live free AND pocket $800/month

### 4. Real Estate Crowdfunding

**Best for:** Investors wanting commercial deals without management

Platforms pool investor money for larger deals.

**Popular platforms:**
- Fundrise (min. $10)
- RealtyMogul (min. $5,000)
- CrowdStreet (accredited investors, $25,000 min.)

**How it works:**
1. Create account
2. Choose investment (debt or equity)
3. Invest your amount
4. Receive distributions (quarterly or annually)
5. Get principal back at project completion

**Pros:**
- Access to commercial deals
- Professional management
- Low minimums
- Diversification

**Cons:**
- Illiquid (money locked 3-7 years)
- Platform risk
- Fees
- Less transparency

### 5. Wholesaling

**Best for:** No money, but have time and hustle

Find deeply discounted properties, put them under contract, and sell the contract to investors.

**How it works:**
1. Find motivated sellers
2. Negotiate below-market price
3. Put property under contract
4. Find cash buyer
5. Assign contract for fee ($5,000-$50,000)

**Pros:**
- No money needed
- No ownership risk
- Quick profits

**Cons:**
- Requires marketing skills
- Finding deals is hard
- Legal complexities
- Not passive income

## How to Analyze a Rental Property

### Step 1: Calculate Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)

Purchase Price ÷ Annual Gross Rent = GRM

- Under 8: Good deal
- 8-12: Okay
- Over 12: Overpriced

### Step 2: Estimate All Expenses

| Expense | Monthly |
|---------|---------|
| Mortgage | $1,500 |
| Property Tax | $300 |
| Insurance | $100 |
| Maintenance | $150 |
| Vacancy (5%) | $100 |
| Property Management | $200 |
| CapEx Reserve | $150 |
| **Total** | **$2,500** |

### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow

Monthly Rent - Monthly Expenses = Cash Flow
$2,000 - $2,500 = -$500 (Negative! Bad deal)

### Step 4: Calculate Cash-on-Cash Return

Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested

Example:
- Annual cash flow: $4,800
- Down payment: $50,000
- Closing costs: $8,000
- Repairs: $12,000
- **Total invested: $70,000**

$4,800 ÷ $70,000 = **6.9% cash-on-cash return**

## Financing Options

### Conventional Loans
- 20-25% down for investment property
- Best rates
- Income verification required

### FHA Loans (House Hacking)
- 3.5% down
- Must live in property
- Up to 4 units

### DSCR Loans (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
- Based on property income, not personal income
- Good for self-employed
- Slightly higher rates

### Private/Hard Money Loans
- Short-term (6-24 months)
- Higher interest (8-15%)
- Fast closing
- Best for flips or bridge financing

## Tax Benefits of Real Estate

### Depreciation
Deduct property value over 27.5 years (residential) even if property appreciates.

$300,000 building ÷ 27.5 = **$10,909 annual deduction**

### Mortgage Interest Deduction
100% of mortgage interest is deductible.

### 1031 Exchange
Defer capital gains by reinvesting into another property within 180 days.

### Pass-Through Deduction
20% deduction on rental income (QBI deduction).

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Not running the numbers:** Emotion leads to overpaying
2. **Underestimating expenses:** Budget 40-50% of rent for expenses
3. **Buying in bad locations:** Job losses = vacancies
4. **Over-leveraging:** Don't stretch too thin
5. **Skipping inspections:** Surprise repairs kill returns
6. **DIY everything:** Your time has value

## Getting Started: Action Plan

**With $1,000:**
- Open brokerage account
- Buy REIT ETF (VNQ, SCHH)
- Reinvest dividends
- Learn while your money grows

**With $10,000:**
- Add real estate crowdfunding (Fundrise)
- Continue building REIT position
- Start saving for down payment

**With $50,000+:**
- Consider house hacking
- Analyze rental property deals
- Build team (realtor, lender, inspector)

## The Bottom Line

Real estate investing isn't just for the wealthy. Start with REITs if you have little capital. Graduate to house hacking or rental properties as you save. The key is starting — time and compound returns do the heavy lifting.

Your first property won't make you rich, but it begins a journey that can lead to financial freedom.
