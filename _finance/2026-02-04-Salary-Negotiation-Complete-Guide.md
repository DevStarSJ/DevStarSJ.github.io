# Salary Negotiation: How to Get Paid What You're Worth

Most people leave money on the table. A single successful negotiation can be worth $500,000+ over your career. Yet most people never try — or try poorly.

This guide gives you everything you need: scripts, strategies, and the confidence to ask for what you deserve.

## Why Negotiation Matters

### The Lifetime Impact

Starting salary of $50,000 vs $55,000 (10% difference):

| Year | No Negotiation | Negotiated | Difference |
|------|----------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | $50,000 | $55,000 | $5,000 |
| 10 | $67,000 | $74,000 | $67,000 total |
| 20 | $90,000 | $99,000 | $180,000 total |
| 30 | $121,000 | $133,000 | $360,000 total |

**One negotiation = $500,000+ lifetime difference** (assuming 3% annual raises).

### The Reality

- **73% of employers expect candidates to negotiate**
- **Only 37% of workers actually negotiate**
- **85% of those who negotiate get something**

## When to Negotiate

### Always Negotiate

✅ Job offers (new position)
✅ Promotions
✅ Annual reviews
✅ After major accomplishments
✅ When taking on new responsibilities

### Think Twice

⚠️ During company-wide layoffs
⚠️ Right after starting (wait 6+ months)
⚠️ Without any research or justification

## The Preparation Phase

### 1. Know Your Market Value

Research thoroughly using:
- **Glassdoor** — Salary reports by company
- **LinkedIn Salary** — Role and location data
- **Levels.fyi** — Tech industry specifics
- **PayScale** — Detailed compensation reports
- **Blind** — Anonymous professional insights

### 2. Document Your Value

Create a "brag document" with:
- Specific accomplishments with numbers
- Projects led or completed
- Revenue generated or costs saved
- Problems solved
- Positive feedback received

### Example Accomplishments

❌ "Helped with the marketing campaign"
✅ "Led Q3 campaign that generated $250K in new revenue"

❌ "Improved team processes"
✅ "Implemented automation that saved 15 hours/week"

### 3. Define Your Range

- **Target**: What you really want
- **Walk-away**: Minimum acceptable
- **Stretch**: Best case scenario

Example:
- Walk-away: $95,000
- Target: $105,000
- Stretch: $115,000

## Negotiating a Job Offer

### Step 1: Express Enthusiasm (Don't Accept Yet)

**When you receive the offer:**

> "Thank you so much for the offer! I'm really excited about this opportunity and working with the team. I'd like to take a day to review the full package. When do you need my response?"

**Never accept on the spot.** Even if it's perfect.

### Step 2: The Counter

**After reviewing:**

> "I've done some research on market rates for this role, and based on my experience with [specific skill] and my track record of [specific achievement], I was hoping for something closer to $X. Is there flexibility in the budget?"

### Key Principles

1. **Let them make the first offer** when possible
2. **Counter with a specific number** (not a range)
3. **Justify with value**, not personal need
4. **Be collaborative**, not combative

### Handling Pushback

**If they say the budget is fixed:**

> "I understand budget constraints. Would you be open to discussing a signing bonus, additional PTO, or an accelerated review timeline? I'm committed to making this work."

**If they say no entirely:**

> "I appreciate you being upfront. I'd still love to join the team. Could we agree to revisit compensation after 6 months once I've demonstrated my impact?"

## Negotiating a Raise

### Timing Matters

**Best times:**
- Performance review cycle
- After a major win
- When given new responsibilities
- After 12-18 months in role

**Prepare in advance** — schedule the meeting 2+ weeks ahead.

### The Conversation

**Opening:**

> "I'd like to discuss my compensation. Over the past year, I've [specific accomplishments], and based on my research, my current salary is below market for someone in my role with my experience."

**Making the ask:**

> "I'm requesting a salary adjustment to $X, which reflects both my contributions and current market rates. Here's what I've prepared to show my impact..."

### If They Say "Not Now"

> "I understand. Can we set a specific date to revisit this conversation? And what would you need to see from me to make this happen?"

Get it in writing. Put the follow-up on the calendar.

## Scripts for Common Scenarios

### When Asked Your Current Salary

> "I'd prefer to focus on the value I can bring to this role. Based on my research and experience, I'm looking for compensation in the $X-Y range."

Note: Many states/cities now prohibit salary history questions.

### When Asked Your Expectations First

> "I'd love to learn more about the role first to give you a thoughtful answer. What's the budgeted range for this position?"

### When the Offer Is Too Low

> "I'm very interested in this role, but the offer is below my expectations based on my research. I was hoping for something in the $X range. Is there room to bridge that gap?"

### When They Ask "Is This Your Final Answer?"

> "I'm being transparent about what would make this an easy yes for me. But I'm open to creative solutions if the base salary is firm."

## Beyond Base Salary

If salary is stuck, negotiate:

| Benefit | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Signing bonus | Immediate cash (often easier to approve) |
| Extra PTO | 5 days = ~2% of salary |
| Remote work | Saves commute time/money |
| Stock/equity | Long-term upside |
| Title | Future earning power |
| Professional development | Conferences, courses, certifications |
| Review timeline | Earlier raise opportunity |
| Relocation | Moving expenses covered |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Accepting immediately** — Always take time to consider
2. **Negotiating via email** — Phone or in-person is better for nuance
3. **Giving a range** — They'll hear only the low number
4. **Making it personal** — Focus on value, not bills
5. **Lying about other offers** — Destroys trust if discovered
6. **Being aggressive** — Collaborative > combative
7. **Not practicing** — Rehearse with a friend

## The Psychology of Negotiation

### Anchoring
The first number mentioned influences everything. If you can, let them anchor first (might be higher than expected). If you must go first, anchor high but justified.

### Silence
After making your ask, **stop talking**. Uncomfortable silence often leads to concessions.

### "No" Is Not Final
First "no" usually means "not yet" or "not that way." Explore alternatives.

### Likability Matters
People give better deals to people they like. Be warm, professional, and collaborative.

## Your Negotiation Checklist

### Before the Conversation
- [ ] Research market rates (3+ sources)
- [ ] Document your accomplishments
- [ ] Define your range (target, walk-away, stretch)
- [ ] Prepare counterarguments
- [ ] Practice with someone

### During the Conversation
- [ ] Express enthusiasm first
- [ ] Make a specific ask with justification
- [ ] Stay silent after asking
- [ ] Listen actively
- [ ] Explore alternatives if needed

### After the Conversation
- [ ] Get the final offer in writing
- [ ] Review all details before signing
- [ ] Send a thank you note
- [ ] Deliver on your promises

## The Bottom Line

Negotiation is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with practice. Most employers expect it. Most successful candidates do it.

The worst they can say is no — and even then, you've signaled that you know your worth.

You've already done the hard work of building valuable skills. Now make sure you're paid for them.
