## Quick Overview

| Feature | 401(k) | IRA |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Offered by | Employer | You open it yourself |
| 2026 Contribution Limit | $23,500 | $7,000 |
| Employer Match | Yes (if offered) | No |
| Investment Options | Limited to plan options | Almost unlimited |
| Required Minimum Distributions | Yes, at age 73 | Traditional: Yes / Roth: No |

## What Is a 401(k)?

A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Your contributions come directly from your paycheck before taxes (Traditional) or after taxes (Roth 401k).

### Key Features of 401(k)

**Contribution Limits (2026):**
- Under 50: $23,500
- Age 50+: $31,000 (includes $7,500 catch-up)

**Employer Match:**
The biggest advantage! Many employers match your contributions:
- Common match: 50% up to 6% of salary
- Example: You earn $100,000, contribute 6% ($6,000)
- Employer adds $3,000 = **$9,000 total**

This is FREE MONEY. Always contribute enough to get the full match.

**Tax Treatment (Traditional 401k):**
- Contributions reduce taxable income NOW
- Money grows tax-deferred
- Pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement

**Roth 401(k):**
- Contribute after-tax dollars
- Money grows tax-free
- Withdraw tax-free in retirement

### 401(k) Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Higher contribution limits than IRA
- Employer matching (free money!)
- Automatic payroll deductions
- Creditor protection

**Cons:**
- Limited investment options
- Higher fees in some plans
- Must leave employer to rollover
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

## What Is an IRA?

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a retirement account you open yourself at a brokerage. You're in complete control of contributions and investments.

### Types of IRAs

**Traditional IRA:**
- Tax-deductible contributions (income limits apply)
- Tax-deferred growth
- Taxed upon withdrawal

**Roth IRA:**
- No tax deduction on contributions
- Tax-free growth
- Tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- No RMDs during your lifetime

### Key Features of IRA

**Contribution Limits (2026):**
- Under 50: $7,000
- Age 50+: $8,000 (includes $1,000 catch-up)

**Income Limits for Roth IRA (2026):**
- Single: Phase-out $150,000-$165,000
- Married Filing Jointly: Phase-out $236,000-$246,000

**Investment Freedom:**
- Stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds
- REITs, options, some alternative investments
- Choose any brokerage (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab)

### IRA Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Unlimited investment options
- Lower fees (you choose your investments)
- No employer required
- Roth IRA has no RMDs

**Cons:**
- Lower contribution limits
- No employer match
- Income limits for Roth contributions
- Requires self-discipline to contribute

## Traditional vs Roth: Which Tax Treatment?

### Choose Traditional If:
- You're in a high tax bracket now
- You expect lower income in retirement
- You need the tax deduction today
- You're close to retirement

### Choose Roth If:
- You're in a lower tax bracket now
- You expect higher income in retirement
- You're young with decades of growth ahead
- You want tax-free income in retirement

**The Math:**
If your tax rate stays the same, Traditional and Roth end up equal. The difference is WHEN you pay taxes, not IF.

## The Optimal Strategy: Use Both

Here's the recommended priority order:

### Step 1: 401(k) Up to Employer Match
- ALWAYS capture free money first
- Even if the 401(k) has mediocre options

### Step 2: Max Out Roth IRA
- Better investment options
- Tax-free growth
- No RMDs

### Step 3: Max Out 401(k)
- Return to 401(k) after IRA is maxed
- Higher limits allow more tax-advantaged saving

### Step 4: Backdoor Roth IRA (If High Income)
- For those exceeding Roth income limits
- Contribute to Traditional IRA, convert to Roth
- Consult a tax professional

### Step 5: Taxable Brokerage
- After maxing tax-advantaged accounts
- Still beneficial for long-term investing

## Special Situations

### Self-Employed? Consider:
- **Solo 401(k):** Up to $69,000 in 2026
- **SEP IRA:** Up to 25% of net self-employment income
- **SIMPLE IRA:** $16,500 employee contribution + employer match

### Changing Jobs?
- Roll old 401(k) into new employer's 401(k)
- Or roll into IRA for more investment options
- Never cash out (huge tax penalty!)

### Spouse Doesn't Work?
- Spousal IRA allows non-working spouse to contribute
- Based on working spouse's income
- Same $7,000 limit

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Getting Full Employer Match
Leaving match money on the table is literally refusing free money.

### 2. Cashing Out When Changing Jobs
You'll pay income tax PLUS 10% penalty. Roll it over instead.

### 3. Only Using One Account Type
Tax diversification matters. Have both Traditional and Roth money.

### 4. Being Too Conservative When Young
With decades until retirement, stocks outperform bonds long-term.

### 5. Ignoring Fees
High-fee funds can cost you hundreds of thousands over a career.

## Action Steps

1. **Check your 401(k):** What's the employer match? Contribute at least that much.

2. **Open an IRA:** Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab offer great options with no minimums.

3. **Decide Traditional vs Roth:** Based on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Automate contributions:** Set up automatic transfers so you never miss a month.

5. **Review annually:** Increase contributions when you get raises.

## The Bottom Line

**Best of both worlds:** Use your 401(k) for the employer match and higher contribution limits. Use your IRA for better investment options and flexibility.

The most important thing isn't which account you choose — it's that you START. Every year you delay costs you compound growth.

Your future retired self is counting on the decisions you make today.
