# Dividend Investing: Build Passive Income That Grows Every Year

Imagine receiving money deposited into your account every month — without working for it. That's the power of dividend investing. While your principal grows, companies pay you just for owning their stock.

Dividend investing isn't about getting rich quick. It's about building a **money machine** that pays you more every year. Let's learn how.

## What Are Dividends?

Dividends are **cash payments** companies make to shareholders from their profits. Think of it as your share of the company's earnings.

### How It Works

1. Company earns profit
2. Board declares a dividend (e.g., $1 per share)
3. On the payment date, you receive $1 for every share you own
4. Repeat quarterly (most US stocks) or monthly (some REITs)

### Key Dividend Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Dividend Yield** | Annual dividend ÷ Stock price (percentage) |
| **Payout Ratio** | Dividends paid ÷ Earnings (sustainability measure) |
| **Ex-Dividend Date** | Buy before this date to receive the next dividend |
| **Dividend Aristocrat** | Company that increased dividends 25+ years straight |

## Why Dividend Investing Works

### 1. Compound Growth
Reinvesting dividends creates exponential growth. A $10,000 investment at 4% yield becomes:
- **Without reinvestment**: $10,000 + $16,000 dividends = $26,000 (40 years)
- **With reinvestment**: Over $48,000 (40 years, assuming constant yield)

### 2. Growing Income
Quality dividend stocks **increase payouts annually**. A 7% annual increase means:
- Year 1: $1,000/year
- Year 10: $1,967/year
- Year 20: $3,870/year
- Year 30: $7,612/year

Same shares, nearly 8x the income.

### 3. Lower Volatility
Dividend stocks tend to be more stable. The regular income cushions downturns.

### 4. Inflation Protection
Growing dividends help maintain purchasing power over time.

## How to Select Dividend Stocks

### The Quality Checklist

✅ **Dividend History**: 10+ years of payments (25+ for Aristocrats)
✅ **Payout Ratio**: Under 60% (under 80% for utilities/REITs)
✅ **Dividend Growth**: Consistent increases, ideally 5%+ annually
✅ **Strong Business**: Competitive advantages, stable earnings
✅ **Reasonable Valuation**: Don't overpay for yield

### Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Extremely high yields (8%+) — often unsustainable
❌ Declining revenue or earnings
❌ Rising debt levels
❌ Payout ratio over 100%
❌ Recent dividend cuts

## Building Your Dividend Portfolio

### Diversification Strategy

**By Sector**:
- Consumer Staples (Coca-Cola, P&G)
- Healthcare (Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie)
- Utilities (Duke Energy, Southern Company)
- Financials (JPMorgan, BlackRock)
- Technology (Microsoft, Apple)
- Real Estate (REITs)

**By Yield Category**:
- High yield (4-6%): Current income focus
- Medium yield (2-4%): Balanced approach
- Low yield (1-2%): Growth focus

### Sample Starter Portfolio

| Stock | Sector | Yield | Dividend Streak |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Johnson & Johnson | Healthcare | ~3.0% | 60+ years |
| Coca-Cola | Consumer | ~3.2% | 60+ years |
| Realty Income | REIT | ~5.5% | 25+ years |
| Microsoft | Technology | ~0.8% | 20+ years |
| Verizon | Telecom | ~6.5% | 15+ years |

## Dividend ETFs: The Easy Path

Don't want to pick individual stocks? Dividend ETFs offer instant diversification.

### Top Dividend ETFs

1. **VYM** (Vanguard High Dividend Yield)
   - 400+ stocks
   - ~3% yield
   - Very low fees (0.06%)

2. **SCHD** (Schwab US Dividend Equity)
   - 100 quality dividend stocks
   - ~3.5% yield
   - Strong track record

3. **DGRO** (iShares Core Dividend Growth)
   - Focus on dividend growth
   - ~2.3% yield
   - Lower current yield, higher growth

## DRIP: The Secret Weapon

**DRIP** (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) automatically reinvests your dividends to buy more shares.

### Why DRIP Matters

- **Automatic compounding** — No manual work
- **Fractional shares** — Every dollar works
- **Dollar-cost averaging** — Buy at various prices
- **Psychological benefit** — Removes temptation to spend

Most brokers offer free DRIP. Enable it immediately.

## Tax Considerations

### Qualified vs. Ordinary Dividends

**Qualified dividends** (most US stocks held 60+ days):
- Taxed at capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)

**Ordinary dividends** (REITs, short-term holdings):
- Taxed as regular income

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Consider holding dividend stocks in:
- **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- **Traditional IRA/401k**: Tax-deferred growth
- **Taxable account**: For qualified dividends (lower tax)

## Building Your Dividend Income: A Timeline

### Years 1-5: Accumulation Phase
- Focus on buying quality dividend stocks
- Reinvest all dividends (DRIP)
- Add new money consistently
- Target: Build positions in 15-20 quality stocks

### Years 5-15: Growth Phase
- Portfolio generates meaningful income
- Continue reinvesting
- Dividend increases accelerate growth
- Target: Dividends cover 10-25% of expenses

### Years 15+: Income Phase
- Option to stop reinvesting
- Live off dividend income
- Dividends potentially cover all expenses
- Principal remains intact (or grows)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Chasing high yields** — Often signals trouble
2. **Ignoring dividend growth** — Growth beats high yield long-term
3. **Lack of diversification** — Don't put everything in one sector
4. **Selling during downturns** — Dividends provide income regardless of price
5. **Not starting early** — Time is your greatest asset
