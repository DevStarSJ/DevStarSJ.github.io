## Tips for Budgeting App Success

### 1. Commit to One App
App-hopping kills progress. Pick one and stick with it for at least 3 months.

### 2. Check Daily (at first)
Review transactions and budgets daily until it becomes habit. Then weekly is fine.

### 3. Be Honest
Don't hide spending or create fake categories. Your budget should reflect reality.

### 4. Adjust as Needed
Your first budget will be wrong. That's okay. Adjust monthly until it fits your life.

### 5. Automate What You Can
Set up automatic imports, recurring transactions, and savings transfers.

## The Best App Is the One You'll Use

The "perfect" budgeting app doesn't exist. The best one is the one that:
- Fits your style
- You'll actually open
- Helps you reach your goals

Most apps offer free trials. Test 2-3, then commit to one. Consistency beats perfection.
