Did you sleep well last night? If you're still tired after 8 hours, your **sleep quality** might be the problem.

## Why Sleep Quality Matters

Sleep isn't just rest. While you sleep, your body:

- 🧠 **Consolidates memories**: Short-term to long-term transfer
- 💪 **Repairs muscles**: Growth hormone release
- 🛡️ **Boosts immunity**: Immune cell regeneration
- 🧹 **Cleans your brain**: Waste removal via glymphatic system

> "Six hours of deep sleep beats eight hours of tossing and turning."

## 1. Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule

This is **the most important habit**.

- Wake up at the same time every day—weekends included
- Go to bed at the same time
- This stabilizes your circadian rhythm

<div class="tip">
If you can wake up naturally without an alarm, your sleep schedule is working.

## 2. Optimize Your Bedroom Environment

### Temperature
- Optimal range: **65-68°F (18-20°C)**
- Too warm disrupts deep sleep stages

### Light
- Complete darkness is ideal
- Even small LED lights suppress melatonin

### Sound
- Consistent white noise is okay
- Sudden noises are the problem

## 3. Block Blue Light

Starting 2 hours before bed:

- 📱 Enable night mode on devices
- 💻 Use blue light filter software
- 🕯️ Switch to warm lighting

<div class="info">
Blue light can suppress melatonin production by up to 50%.

## 4. Limit Caffeine & Alcohol

### Caffeine
- Half-life: 5-6 hours
- No coffee after 2 PM
- Remember: chocolate and green tea contain caffeine too

### Alcohol
- Makes falling asleep easier BUT
- Disrupts REM sleep
- Causes frequent waking

## 5. Exercise Regularly

- At least 3 times per week, 30+ minutes
- Finish workouts **3 hours before bed**
- Late exercise can leave you wired

## 6. Mind Your Evening Meals

- Finish eating 3 hours before bed
- Overeating diverts energy to digestion
- Late meals risk acid reflux

### Sleep-Promoting Foods
- 🍌 Bananas (magnesium, tryptophan)
- 🥛 Warm milk
- 🍒 Cherries (natural melatonin)
- 🥜 Almonds (magnesium)

## 7. Create a Bedtime Routine

30-60 minutes before sleep:

1. Warm shower or bath
2. Light stretching
3. Reading (physical book)
4. Meditation or breathing exercises

<div class="warning">
Using your phone in bed trains your brain that "bed = alertness."
</div>

## Bonus: The 4-7-8 Breathing Method

Try this when you can't fall asleep:

1. **Inhale** through nose for **4 seconds**
2. **Hold** for **7 seconds**
3. **Exhale** through mouth for **8 seconds**
4. Repeat 4 times
