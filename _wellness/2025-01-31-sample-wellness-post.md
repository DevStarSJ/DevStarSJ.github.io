Our eyes are under constant assault. Smartphones, computers, TVs... we're exposed to blue light all day long. Here's how to protect your vision.

## What Are Lutein and Zeaxanthin?

Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants. They concentrate in the macula of your eye and act as **natural sunglasses**, filtering harmful light.

> "Macular pigment filters blue light and protects the retina from oxidative stress."

## Key Benefits

### 1. Blue Light Protection
These nutrients absorb harmful blue light from digital devices, preventing retinal damage.

### 2. Macular Degeneration Prevention
They reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss.

### 3. Reduced Eye Fatigue
Less strain and dryness during long screen sessions.

## Daily Recommended Intake

- **Lutein**: 10-20mg
- **Zeaxanthin**: 2-4mg
