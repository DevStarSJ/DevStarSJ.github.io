Back pain affects 80% of adults at some point in their lives. Whether it's from sitting at a desk, poor posture, or muscle imbalances, the good news is that most back pain responds well to the right exercises. Here are 10 proven moves to relieve pain and build a stronger, more resilient back.

## Understanding Back Pain

Before diving into exercises, it's helpful to understand common causes:

- **Muscle imbalances**: Weak core and tight hip flexors
- **Poor posture**: Prolonged sitting, forward head position
- **Sedentary lifestyle**: Lack of movement weakens supporting muscles
- **Overuse or strain**: Improper lifting, sudden movements

Most non-specific back pain improves with movement, not rest. The exercises below address the root causes while providing immediate relief.

## Part 1: Stretching Exercises

This gentle flow mobilizes the entire spine and relieves tension.

4. Flow between positions for 10-15 repetitions

**Targets**: Entire spine mobility, relieves stiffness

### 2. Child's Pose

A restorative stretch that decompresses the lower back.

**How to do it**:
