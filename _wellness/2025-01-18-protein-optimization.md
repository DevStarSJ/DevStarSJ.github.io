Protein isn't just for bodybuilders. It's the most important macronutrient for body composition, satiety, and healthy aging.

## Why Protein Matters

Protein provides amino acids—the building blocks for:

- Muscle tissue
- Enzymes and hormones
- Immune function
- Skin, hair, and nails
- Neurotransmitters

> "You can survive without carbs. You can survive without fat. You cannot survive without protein."

## How Much Protein Do You Need?

### The RDA is Too Low
The Recommended Daily Allowance (0.8 g/kg) is the **minimum to prevent deficiency**, not the optimal amount for health.

### Optimal Ranges

| Goal | Daily Protein |
|------|---------------|
| General health | 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight |
| Muscle building | 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight |
| Fat loss | 1.8-2.4 g/kg body weight |
| Athletes | 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight |
| Older adults (60+) | 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight |

**Example**: A 70 kg person aiming for muscle gain needs 112-154g protein daily.

<div class="tip">
When in doubt, aim for 1 gram per pound of goal body weight (2.2 g/kg). It's simple and effective.
</div>

## Benefits of Higher Protein

### 1. Muscle Building & Preservation
Essential for muscle protein synthesis and preventing age-related muscle loss.

### 2. Fat Loss
- Highest thermic effect (burns 20-30% of calories during digestion)
- Most satiating macronutrient
- Preserves muscle during caloric deficit

### 3. Bone Health
Protein provides amino acids for bone matrix. Higher intake = stronger bones.

### 4. Appetite Control
Protein keeps you fuller longer, reducing overall calorie intake.

### 5. Blood Sugar Stability
Slows carbohydrate absorption when eaten together.

<div class="info">
Studies show high protein diets are safe for healthy kidneys. The "protein damages kidneys" myth has been debunked.

## Best Protein Sources

### Animal Sources (Complete Proteins)

| Food | Protein per 100g |
|------|------------------|
| Chicken breast | 31g |
| Beef (lean) | 26g |
| Fish (salmon) | 25g |
| Eggs | 13g (6g per egg) |
| Greek yogurt | 10g |
| Cottage cheese | 11g |

### Plant Sources

| Food | Protein per 100g |
|------|------------------|
| Tofu | 8g |
| Tempeh | 19g |
| Lentils (cooked) | 9g |
| Chickpeas (cooked) | 9g |
| Edamame | 11g |
| Seitan | 25g |

### Complete vs Incomplete Proteins
- **Animal proteins**: Complete (all essential amino acids)
- **Plant proteins**: Often incomplete (combine different sources)

## Protein Timing

### Does Timing Matter?
For most people, **total daily intake matters more than timing**. But for optimization:

### Optimal Distribution
**Spread intake across 3-4 meals** with 25-40g per meal.
- Better for muscle protein synthesis
- More practical than one huge meal

### Post-Workout Window
The "anabolic window" is larger than thought:
- Eating protein within **2-3 hours** after training is sufficient
- Pre-workout protein counts too

### Before Bed
**Casein protein or Greek yogurt** before sleep:
- Slow-digesting protein
- Supports overnight muscle recovery
- May improve next-day performance

<div class="warning">
Extremely high single doses (60g+) aren't absorbed better than moderate doses. Your body can only use so much at once for muscle synthesis.
</div>

## Protein Supplements

### When to Use
- Difficulty hitting protein goals from food
- Convenience (post-workout, travel)
- Not as a replacement for whole foods

### Best Options
1. **Whey protein**: Fast-absorbing, great post-workout
2. **Casein**: Slow-digesting, great before bed
3. **Plant blends**: Pea + rice for complete amino profile
4. **Collagen**: Supports joints and skin (not for muscle building)

### Quality Matters
- Look for third-party testing (NSF, Informed Sport)
- Minimal ingredients
- Check for heavy metal contamination in cheap brands

## High-Protein Day Example

**Breakfast** (30g protein)
- 3 eggs + 2 egg whites
- Greek yogurt

**Lunch** (40g protein)
- Chicken breast (150g)
- Vegetables + rice

**Snack** (20g protein)
- Protein shake or cottage cheese

**Dinner** (40g protein)
- Salmon (170g)
- Vegetables + potatoes

**Total: 130g protein**

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Backloading Protein
Eating most protein at dinner. Spread it out.

### 2. Protein-Only Thinking
Still need carbs and fats for performance and hormones.

### 3. Ignoring Leucine
Leucine triggers muscle synthesis. Animal proteins and whey are rich in leucine.

### 4. Fear of "Too Much"
For healthy individuals, high protein is safe and beneficial.

Protein is the one macronutrient almost everyone would benefit from eating more of. Track your intake for a week—you might be surprised how low it is. Then adjust. Your muscles, metabolism, and hunger levels will thank you. 🥩
