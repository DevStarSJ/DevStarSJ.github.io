excerpt: "Up to 75% of people don't get enough magnesium. Learn why this mineral is crucial for 300+ bodily functions and how to optimize your intake."

It's involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in your body, yet most people are deficient. Meet magnesium—the master mineral.

## Why Magnesium Matters

Magnesium is required for:

- **Energy production** (ATP synthesis)
- **Muscle and nerve function**
- **Blood sugar regulation**
- **Blood pressure management**
- **Protein synthesis**
- **DNA and RNA synthesis**
- **Bone development**

> "Magnesium deficiency is the most under-diagnosed health problem in modern medicine."

## Signs of Deficiency

### Common Symptoms
- Muscle cramps and twitches
- Poor sleep or insomnia
- Anxiety and restlessness
- Headaches and migraines
- Fatigue and weakness
- Irregular heartbeat
- High blood pressure

### Who's at Risk?
- People eating processed foods
- Heavy exercisers (sweating depletes magnesium)
- Those under chronic stress
- Alcohol consumers
- People taking certain medications
- Older adults

<div class="info">
Blood tests for magnesium are often misleading—only 1% of magnesium is in blood. Deficiency can exist even with "normal" blood levels.
</div>

## Benefits of Optimal Magnesium

### 1. Better Sleep
Magnesium activates the parasympathetic nervous system and regulates melatonin.

### 2. Reduced Stress & Anxiety
It modulates the HPA axis (stress response) and GABA receptors.

### 3. Muscle Recovery
Essential for muscle relaxation and reducing cramps.

### 4. Heart Health
Supports healthy blood pressure and heart rhythm.

### 5. Blood Sugar Control
Improves insulin sensitivity.

### 6. Migraine Prevention
Studies show 400-500mg can reduce migraine frequency.

## Types of Magnesium Supplements

Not all magnesium is created equal:

### Best Absorbed Forms

| Form | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Magnesium Glycinate** | Sleep, anxiety, general use |
| **Magnesium L-Threonate** | Brain health, cognitive function |
| **Magnesium Taurate** | Heart health |
| **Magnesium Malate** | Energy, muscle pain |
| **Magnesium Citrate** | Constipation, general use |

### Avoid
- **Magnesium Oxide**: Only 4% absorption rate
- Cheap "magnesium" supplements without specified form

<div class="tip">
Magnesium glycinate is the most versatile and well-tolerated form. Start there if unsure.
</div>

## How Much Do You Need?

### Recommended Daily Intake
- Men: 400-420 mg
- Women: 310-320 mg

### Therapeutic Doses
- For sleep: 200-400 mg before bed
- For migraines: 400-500 mg daily
- For stress: 200-400 mg daily

### Upper Limit from Supplements
- 350 mg from supplements (food sources don't count toward this)
- Higher doses may cause digestive upset

## Food Sources of Magnesium

### High-Magnesium Foods
- 🥬 Dark leafy greens (spinach, swiss chard)
- 🥜 Nuts (almonds, cashews)
- 🫘 Seeds (pumpkin, sunflower)
- 🫘 Legumes (black beans, edamame)
- 🍫 Dark chocolate (70%+ cacao)
- 🥑 Avocado
- 🐟 Fatty fish
- 🍌 Bananas

<div class="warning">
Soil depletion has reduced magnesium content in foods by up to 50% over the past century. Supplementation may be necessary even with a healthy diet.
</div>

## Optimizing Absorption

### Enhancers
- Vitamin B6 (helps magnesium enter cells)
- Vitamin D (works synergistically)
- Taking with food

### Inhibitors
- High-dose calcium (competes for absorption)
- Phytic acid (in grains/legumes)
- Excessive caffeine
- Alcohol

## Timing Your Magnesium

### For Sleep
Take **30-60 minutes before bed** for best results.

### For Exercise
Take **post-workout** for recovery.

### For General Health
Split doses throughout the day, or take with dinner.

## Starting a Magnesium Protocol

### Week 1-2
- Start with 200 mg magnesium glycinate at bedtime
- Monitor sleep quality and any digestive effects

### Week 3-4
- Increase to 300-400 mg if tolerated
- Note changes in energy, mood, and muscle tension

### Ongoing
- Adjust dose based on symptoms
- Consider adding magnesium-rich foods
