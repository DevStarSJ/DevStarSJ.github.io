What if shining specific wavelengths of light on your body could reduce inflammation, improve skin, and speed recovery?

## What is Red Light Therapy?

Red light therapy (RLT), also called photobiomodulation, uses specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light to penetrate skin and tissues, triggering cellular responses.

> "Light is a drug. The right wavelengths, at the right dose, can be therapeutic."

## The Science: How It Works

### Mitochondrial Activation
Red and near-infrared light are absorbed by **cytochrome c oxidase** in your mitochondria, boosting ATP (energy) production.

### Key Wavelengths
- **Red light (630-660nm)**: Penetrates skin, great for surface-level benefits
- **Near-infrared (810-850nm)**: Penetrates deeper into muscle, joints, and organs

### Cellular Effects
- Increased ATP production
- Reduced oxidative stress
- Improved blood flow
- Decreased inflammation
- Enhanced collagen production

<div class="info">
Red light therapy has over 5,000 peer-reviewed studies supporting various benefits.

## Proven Benefits

### 1. Skin Health
- Reduced wrinkles and fine lines
- Improved skin tone and texture
- Faster wound healing
- Help with acne and psoriasis

### 2. Pain & Inflammation
- Joint pain relief
- Reduced muscle soreness
- Faster injury recovery
- Arthritis symptom improvement

### 3. Muscle Recovery
- Reduced delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
- Faster strength recovery
- Improved endurance performance
- Used by professional athletes

### 4. Hair Growth
- Stimulates hair follicles
- May slow hair loss
- FDA-cleared devices available

### 5. Other Potential Benefits
- Improved thyroid function
- Better sleep
- Enhanced testosterone (preliminary research)
- Mood improvement
- Cognitive benefits

<div class="tip">
Consistency matters more than session length. Daily 10-minute sessions beat weekly 30-minute sessions.

## How to Use Red Light Therapy

### Distance
- **6-12 inches** from the device for most benefits
- Closer for skin, slightly farther for deeper penetration

### Duration
- **10-20 minutes** per area
- Daily use is safe and often recommended

### Timing
- Morning: Energy and mood boost
- Post-workout: Recovery enhancement
- Evening: Avoid too close to bedtime (can be stimulating)

### What to Wear
- **Less is more**: Light doesn't penetrate clothing well
- Target exposed skin for best results

## Choosing a Device

### Panel Size
- **Small panels**: Face and targeted areas
- **Full-body panels**: Comprehensive treatment but expensive

### Power Output
- Look for **irradiance** specs (mW/cm²)
- Higher isn't always better—proper dosing matters

### Wavelength Coverage
- Best devices offer **both red (660nm) AND near-infrared (850nm)**

### Price Range
- Budget: $100-300 (small panels)
- Mid-range: $300-800 (larger panels)
- Premium: $800-3000 (full-body setups)

<div class="warning">
Be cautious of cheap devices with unverified wavelengths or insufficient power. Quality matters for therapeutic effects.
</div>

## What to Expect

### Week 1-2
- May notice improved skin texture
- Some report better sleep
- Minimal visible changes

### Week 4-8
- Noticeable skin improvements
- Reduced inflammation and pain
- Better workout recovery

### Month 3+
- Significant skin transformation
- Cumulative benefits continue
- Hair growth visible (if applicable)

## Safety Considerations

### Generally Safe For
- Most healthy adults
- Daily use at recommended doses

### Precautions
- Avoid looking directly at bright panels
- May not be suitable with certain medications (photosensitivity)
- Start with shorter sessions

### Not a Replacement For
- Medical treatment
- Sunscreen (doesn't protect against UV)
- Healthy lifestyle habits
