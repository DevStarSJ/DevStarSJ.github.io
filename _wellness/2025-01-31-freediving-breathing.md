Freediving isn't just a sport—it's a moving meditation, an art of breath, and a journey into your own limits.

## What is Freediving?

Freediving is diving underwater on a single breath, without scuba gear. While it's a competitive sport, many people practice it for **mental clarity** and **self-discovery**.

> "Underwater, all thoughts disappear. Only you and the ocean exist."

## The Foundation: Diaphragmatic Breathing

The core of freediving is **diaphragmatic breathing** (belly breathing).

### How to Practice

1. Lie down or sit **comfortably**
2. Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly
3. **Inhale slowly through your nose** (4 seconds) - belly rises
4. **Hold briefly** (2 seconds)
5. **Exhale slowly through your mouth** (6 seconds) - belly falls

<div class="tip">
Start with just 10 minutes daily. Once it becomes natural, you'll breathe this way automatically.
</div>

## Full Breathing Technique

This maximizes lung capacity before a dive.

### Three-Phase Breathing

1. **Abdominal phase**: Fill your belly completely
2. **Thoracic phase**: Expand your ribcage sideways
3. **Clavicular phase**: Raise shoulders slightly for the last bit of air

## Relaxation Breathing

Perform this for 2 minutes before your dive.

- **Inhale**: 2 seconds
- **Hold**: 2 seconds
- **Exhale**: 10 seconds (as slowly as possible)

<div class="info">
Tension dramatically increases oxygen consumption. Relaxation is not optional—it's essential.
</div>

## Critical Safety Rules

### Never Do This

- ❌ **Hyperventilation**: Lowers CO2 and increases blackout risk
- ❌ **Solo practice**: Always dive with a buddy
- ❌ **Push too hard**: Respect your limits

### Blackout Prevention

Hyperventilation is extremely dangerous. When CO2 levels drop too low, your brain delays the "breathe now" signal, causing sudden loss of consciousness.

<div class="warning">
Always learn freediving through certified courses. Self-teaching is extremely dangerous.
</div>

## Dry Training

You can train without water:

### CO2 Tolerance Table
- Breath-hold time stays constant (e.g., 2 min)
- Rest time decreases (2:00 → 1:45 → 1:30...)

### O2 Table
- Rest time stays constant (e.g., 2 min)
- Breath-hold time increases (2:00 → 2:15 → 2:30...)

## Benefits of Freediving

- 🧘 **Stress reduction**: Forced meditative state
- 💪 **Increased lung capacity**: Strengthens respiratory muscles
- 🧠 **Improved focus**: Present-moment awareness
- 😌 **Self-confidence**: Experience of transcending limits

Freediving teaches patience and humility. The ocean never welcomes those who rush. 🌊
