### Why Does Connection Fail When AWS RDS Average Active Session is High?

AWS RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service) is a cloud-based relational database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. However, when the Average Active Session (AAS) is high, you may encounter Connection Failures, which can cause your applications to stop working. In this article, we'll explore the reasons why Connection Failures occur when the AAS is high and what you can do to resolve them.

## Average Active Session

`Average Active Session` (AAS) is a metric that measures the average number of active sessions in a database. It is a good indicator of the database's utilization rate. If the AAS is high, it means that the database is heavily utilized, and if the AAS is low, it means that the database is not being utilized to its full capacity.

## Connection Failures

Connection Failures occur when a client is unable to connect to an RDS instance. Connection Failures can be caused by various factors, including network issues, security group rules, and database configuration. Monitoring Connection Failures is important to ensure that your RDS instances are always available to your clients.

## The Connection Between AAS and Connection Failures

When the AAS is high, it means that the database is heavily utilized, which can cause Connection Failures. If the database is processing too many requests at once, it may not be able to handle the load and respond to client requests in a timely manner, resulting in Connection Failures.

To resolve Connection Failures caused by a high AAS, you need to optimize the database's performance. You can do this by:

- Scaling the database horizontally, by adding more database instances
- Scaling the database vertically, by upgrading the hardware resources of the database instance
- Optimizing the database's configuration, such as increasing the connection timeout and buffer pool size

```python
import boto3

rds = boto3.client('rds')

def modify_instance(instance_id, storage_size, buffer_pool_size, connection_timeout):
    rds.modify_db_instance(
        DBInstanceIdentifier=instance_id,
        AllocatedStorage=storage_size,
        DBInstanceClass='db.t2.medium',
        ApplyImmediately=True,
        MaxAllocatedStorage=storage_size,
        OptionGroupName='default:mysql-5-7',
        OptionSettings=[
            {
                'Name': 'innodb_buffer_pool_size',
                'Value': buffer_pool_size
            },
            {
                'Name': 'wait_timeout',
                'Value': connection_timeout
            },
        ]
    )
```

In conclusion, when the AAS is high, it can lead to Connection Failures. To resolve Connection Failures, you need to optimize the database's performance by scaling the database horizontally or vertically and optimizing the database's configuration.
