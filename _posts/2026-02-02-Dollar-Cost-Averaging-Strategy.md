# Dollar Cost Averaging: The Simple Strategy That Beats Most Investors

You've saved some money. You want to invest. But the market feels scary—what if you buy at the top?

Here's a secret: **you don't need to time the market**. Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is how regular people build serious wealth.

## What Is Dollar Cost Averaging?

Dollar cost averaging means **investing a fixed amount at regular intervals**, regardless of price.

- Same amount
- Same schedule
- Every time

No timing. No guessing. No stress.

### Example

You invest $500 every month in an S&P 500 index fund:

| Month | Price | Shares Bought |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| January | $100 | 5.00 |
| February | $80 | 6.25 |
| March | $90 | 5.56 |
| April | $110 | 4.55 |
| May | $95 | 5.26 |

**Total invested:** $2,500
**Total shares:** 26.62
**Average cost per share:** $93.91

Notice: You bought MORE shares when prices were LOW. This is the magic of DCA.

## Why DCA Works

### 1. Removes Emotional Decision-Making

The market crashed 20%? You buy anyway.
The market hit all-time highs? You buy anyway.

No panic. No FOMO. Just consistent investing.

### 2. Reduces Timing Risk

Nobody—not even professionals—can consistently time the market. DCA spreads your risk across time.

### 3. Builds Discipline

Automatic investing creates automatic wealth. It becomes a habit, not a decision.

### 4. Takes Advantage of Volatility

Market swings become your friend. Lower prices = more shares. Over time, this compounds.

## DCA vs. Lump Sum Investing

Let's compare two strategies with $12,000:

**DCA:** Invest $1,000/month for 12 months
**Lump Sum:** Invest $12,000 on day one

### Historical Data

Studies show lump sum beats DCA about 2/3 of the time—because markets generally go up.

**But here's reality:**
- Most people don't have $12,000 sitting around
- Most people can't handle watching $12,000 drop 30%
- DCA lets you invest as you earn

**DCA wins for most real humans.**

## How to Start Dollar Cost Averaging

### Step 1: Choose Your Investment

For most people, a low-cost index fund:

| Fund Type | Example | Expense Ratio |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Total Market | VTI, ITOT | 0.03% |
| S&P 500 | VOO, SPY | 0.03% |
| International | VXUS | 0.07% |
| Target Date | VTTSX | 0.15% |

### Step 2: Decide Your Amount

Rules of thumb:
- **At least 15%** of income for retirement
- **Start with what you can**: Even $50/month compounds
- **Increase over time**: Add 1% each year

### Step 3: Set Up Automation

Most brokerages offer automatic investing:

1. **Fidelity** - Free automatic investments
2. **Vanguard** - Automatic investment plans
3. **Schwab** - Automatic investing
4. **M1 Finance** - Perfect for DCA

### Step 4: Forget About It

Seriously. Don't check daily. Set it and let it run for years.

## Common DCA Mistakes

### ❌ Stopping During Downturns

This is the WORST time to stop. Lower prices = more shares = more growth when recovery comes.

### ❌ Checking Too Often

Daily portfolio watching leads to emotional decisions. Check quarterly at most.

### ❌ Not Increasing Contributions

Got a raise? Increase your DCA amount. Your lifestyle can wait.

### ❌ Picking Individual Stocks

DCA works best with diversified funds. Individual stocks are gambling, not investing.

## The Math: 30 Years of DCA

**Assumptions:**
- $500/month
- 7% average annual return
- 30 years

| Year | Total Invested | Portfolio Value |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| 5 | $30,000 | $35,796 |
| 10 | $60,000 | $86,541 |
| 15 | $90,000 | $158,376 |
| 20 | $120,000 | $260,464 |
| 25 | $150,000 | $405,530 |
| 30 | $180,000 | **$610,729** |

You invested $180,000. You have $610,000. That's **$430,000 in free money** from compound growth.

## DCA for Different Goals

### Retirement (20-40 years)
- 100% stocks is fine early on
- Target date funds handle rebalancing
- Max out tax-advantaged accounts first (401k, IRA)

### Medium-Term Goals (5-15 years)
- 60/40 or 70/30 stock/bond mix
- Less aggressive, but still DCA
- Consider a taxable brokerage account

### Short-Term (Under 5 years)
- DCA not recommended
- Use high-yield savings instead
- Too little time to recover from drops

## When to Stop DCA

You don't stop—you shift:

1. **Accumulation Phase**: DCA into growth assets
2. **Transition Phase**: Start DCA into bonds/stable assets
3. **Withdrawal Phase**: Systematic withdrawals (reverse DCA)

## Action Plan

**This Week:**
1. Open a brokerage account (if needed)
2. Choose one index fund
3. Set up automatic investment
4. Start with $100/month minimum

**This Year:**
1. Increase contributions with every raise
2. Don't touch it during market drops
3. Add more accounts (Roth IRA, etc.)

## The Bottom Line

Dollar cost averaging isn't exciting. It won't make you rich overnight. But it's how ordinary people become millionaires:

- **Consistent** beats clever
- **Time in market** beats timing the market
- **Automation** beats willpower

Start today. Your future self is counting on it.
