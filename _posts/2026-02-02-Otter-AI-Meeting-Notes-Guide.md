# Otter.ai: Never Take Meeting Notes Again

You're in a meeting, trying to listen *and* type notes *and* think of questions. It doesn't work. **Otter.ai** listens for you, transcribes everything, and summarizes the important parts.

## What Otter.ai Does

- **Real-time transcription** - Words appear as people speak
- **Speaker identification** - Knows who said what
- **Automatic summaries** - Key points extracted
- **Action items** - Tasks automatically detected
- **Meeting integration** - Joins Zoom/Teams/Meet automatically

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Account

Go to [otter.ai](https://otter.ai) and sign up. Free tier gives you 300 minutes/month.

### 2. Connect Your Calendar

Link Google Calendar or Outlook:
- Otter sees your upcoming meetings
- Auto-joins when meetings start
- No manual setup needed

### 3. Install the Apps

- **Desktop app** - For in-person meetings (uses laptop mic)
- **Mobile app** - Record on the go
- **Chrome extension** - Quick access to transcripts

## How It Works in Practice

### Virtual Meetings

Before a Zoom call:

1. Otter sees the meeting on your calendar
2. "OtterPilot" bot joins automatically
3. Bot transcribes the entire meeting
4. You get summary email within minutes

You don't have to do anything. It just works.

### In-Person Meetings

Open the Otter app and hit record:

1. Place your phone/laptop where it can hear everyone
2. Otter transcribes in real-time
3. You can add highlights by tapping
4. Edit transcript after if needed

## Key Features

### OtterPilot (Auto-Join)

The killer feature. Configure once:

1. Go to Settings → OtterPilot
2. Enable "Auto-join meetings"
3. Choose which calendar events to join
4. Set notification preferences

OtterPilot joins, introduces itself, transcribes, and leaves. Attendees see it as a participant.

### Speaker Identification

Otter learns voices over time:

- First meeting: "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2"
- You label who's who
- Future meetings: Names assigned automatically

Train it on your regular meeting participants and it gets accurate fast.

### AI Chat

Ask questions about your meetings:

```
"What did Sarah say about the budget?"
"List all the deadlines mentioned"
"Summarize John's feedback on the design"
```

The AI searches across all your transcripts and gives answers with timestamps.

### Action Items

Otter detects when someone commits to something:

> "I'll send over the proposal by Friday"

This becomes an action item:
- **Owner:** The speaker
- **Task:** Send proposal
- **Due:** Friday

Action items are collected in a separate section for easy follow-up.

### Collaborative Editing

Share transcripts with your team:

- Highlight important sections
- Add comments
- Correct transcription errors
- Create clips for specific moments

Everyone on the team can access and contribute.

## Integration Guide

### Zoom

1. Connect Zoom account in Otter settings
2. Enable OtterPilot for Zoom
3. Otter bot joins all Zoom meetings automatically

Works with both scheduled and instant meetings.

### Microsoft Teams

1. Install Otter from Teams app store
2. Authorize the connection
3. OtterPilot joins Teams meetings

Note: Requires Teams admin approval in some organizations.

### Google Meet
