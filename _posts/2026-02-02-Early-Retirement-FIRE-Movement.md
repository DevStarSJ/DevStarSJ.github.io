# FIRE Movement: How to Retire in Your 40s (or Earlier)

What if you didn't have to work until 65? What if you could retire at 45? Or 40? Or even 35?

This isn't fantasy—it's the **FIRE movement**: Financial Independence, Retire Early.

## What Is FIRE?

FIRE stands for **Financial Independence, Retire Early**. The core idea:

1. **Save aggressively** (50-70% of income)
2. **Invest wisely** (low-cost index funds)
3. **Build a portfolio** that covers living expenses forever
4. **Retire** when your investments generate enough passive income

"Retirement" doesn't mean sitting on a beach (though you can). It means **work becomes optional**.

## The Math Behind FIRE

### The 4% Rule

The foundation of FIRE is the **4% rule**: You can withdraw 4% of your portfolio annually with minimal risk of running out over 30+ years.

**Formula:**
```
Annual expenses × 25 = FIRE number
```

**Examples:**

| Annual Expenses | FIRE Number |
|-----------------|-------------|
| $30,000 | $750,000 |
| $40,000 | $1,000,000 |
| $50,000 | $1,250,000 |
| $60,000 | $1,500,000 |
| $80,000 | $2,000,000 |

Spend $40,000/year? You need $1 million to retire.

### How Long Does It Take?

Your savings rate determines your timeline more than income:

| Savings Rate | Years to FIRE |
|--------------|---------------|
| 10% | 51 years |
| 20% | 37 years |
| 30% | 28 years |
| 40% | 22 years |
| 50% | 17 years |
| 60% | 12.5 years |
| 70% | 8.5 years |

At 50% savings rate, you could retire in **17 years** regardless of whether you earn $50k or $500k.

## Types of FIRE

### 1. Traditional FIRE

- Retire with enough to maintain current lifestyle
- Target: 25x annual expenses
- Example: $50k expenses → $1.25M portfolio

### 2. Lean FIRE

- Retire with minimal, frugal lifestyle
- Target: $25-40k/year expenses
- Portfolio: $625k-$1M
- Best for: Minimalists, low-cost-of-living areas

### 3. Fat FIRE

- Retire with comfortable/luxurious lifestyle
- Target: $100k+/year expenses
- Portfolio: $2.5M+
- Best for: High earners who want to maintain lifestyle

### 4. Barista FIRE

- Semi-retirement with part-time work
- Portfolio covers most expenses
- Part-time job covers healthcare + extras
- Best for: Those who want some structure/social interaction

### 5. Coast FIRE

- Save enough early, then let compound interest do the work
- Stop aggressive saving, coast to traditional retirement
- Best for: Those who want to downshift careers

## How to Achieve FIRE

### Step 1: Calculate Your FIRE Number

1. Track expenses for 3-6 months
2. Identify your ideal retirement spending
3. Multiply by 25

**Example:**
- Current expenses: $4,500/month ($54,000/year)
- Retirement expenses (no commute, etc.): $3,500/month ($42,000/year)
- FIRE number: $42,000 × 25 = **$1,050,000**

### Step 2: Increase Your Savings Rate

The single most important factor. Target **50%+ if possible**.

**Strategies:**

**Housing (often 30% of budget):**
- House hack (rent out rooms)
- Move to lower cost-of-living area
- Downsize

**Transportation (15% of budget):**
- One car household
- Used cars only
- Public transit/bike

**Food (10-15% of budget):**
- Meal prep
- Limit dining out
- Avoid food waste

**Lifestyle (varies):**
- Cut subscriptions ruthlessly
- Find free entertainment
- Avoid lifestyle inflation

### Step 3: Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts

| Account | 2026 Limit | Tax Benefit |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| 401(k) | $23,500 | Pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth) |
| IRA | $7,000 | Pre-tax or Roth |
| HSA | $4,300 (single) | Triple tax advantage |
| 401(k) catch-up (50+) | $7,500 | Additional contribution |

**Priority:**
1. 401(k) up to employer match (free money!)
2. HSA (if eligible)
3. Max Roth IRA
4. Max 401(k)
5. Taxable brokerage

### Step 4: Invest Consistently

Keep it simple:

**Recommended portfolio:**
- 80-90% Total Stock Market (VTI, VTSAX)
- 10-20% International (VXUS, VTIAX)
- Optional: Bonds closer to FIRE date

**Rules:**
- Dollar-cost average monthly
- Never try to time the market
- Rebalance annually
- Ignore short-term volatility

### Step 5: Optimize and Track

**Track:**
- Net worth monthly
- Savings rate monthly
- Progress to FIRE number

**Optimize:**
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Credit card rewards (travel hacking)
- Side hustles for faster progress

## The FIRE Timeline

Let's follow Alex, who earns $80,000/year:

| Year | Savings (50%) | Portfolio Value | Progress |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| 0 | $40,000 | $40,000 | 4% |
| 5 | $40,000 | $264,000 | 26% |
| 10 | $40,000 | $615,000 | 62% |
| 12 | $40,000 | $805,000 | 81% |
| 15 | $40,000 | $1,108,000 | 100%+ |

**Alex reaches FIRE in ~15 years!** (Assuming $40k/year retirement expenses, 7% returns)

## Accessing Money Before 59.5

Traditional retirement accounts have early withdrawal penalties. FIRE has solutions:

### 1. Roth IRA Contributions

You can withdraw **contributions** (not earnings) anytime, penalty-free.

### 2. Roth Conversion Ladder

Convert Traditional IRA to Roth, wait 5 years, withdraw penalty-free.

### 3. 72(t)/SEPP

Substantially Equal Periodic Payments allow early withdrawals without penalty.

### 4. Taxable Brokerage

No restrictions, just capital gains tax (favorable if held 1+ year).

**Strategy:** Build 5 years of expenses in taxable accounts + Roth contributions for the bridge to 59.5.

## Common FIRE Mistakes

### ❌ Underestimating Healthcare

US healthcare is expensive. Budget $500-$1,500/month until Medicare (65).

**Solutions:**
- ACA marketplace (subsidies if income is low)
- Part-time job with benefits (Barista FIRE)
- Health sharing ministries
- Move abroad (many countries have affordable healthcare)

### ❌ Ignoring Inflation

$40,000 today ≠ $40,000 in 20 years.

**Solution:** The 4% rule accounts for this—your portfolio grows with inflation.

### ❌ Forgetting About Sequence Risk

Big market drops early in retirement can devastate your portfolio.

**Solutions:**
- 2-3 years cash buffer
- Flexible withdrawal rate (3-4%)
- Part-time work as backup

### ❌ Not Having a Purpose

Many FIRE achievers get bored or depressed without work.

**Solution:** Know your "why." Have projects, hobbies, volunteering planned.

## Is FIRE Right for You?

- You're willing to live differently than most

The math is simple. The execution is hard. But millions have done it—and so can you.
