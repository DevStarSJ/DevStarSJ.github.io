## What Is an ETF?

An **Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)** is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange like a stock. Think of it as buying a slice of hundreds or thousands of companies in a single transaction.

### ETF vs. Individual Stocks

| Aspect | ETF | Individual Stock |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| Diversification | Hundreds of companies | One company |
| Risk | Lower (spread out) | Higher (concentrated) |
| Research needed | Less | More |
| Fees | Low (0.03-0.5%) | Commission per trade |
| Dividends | Aggregated | Company-specific |

### ETF vs. Mutual Funds

| Aspect | ETF | Mutual Fund |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Trading | Real-time | End of day |
| Minimum investment | 1 share | Often $1,000+ |
| Expense ratio | Usually lower | Usually higher |
| Tax efficiency | More efficient | Less efficient |

## Types of ETFs

### 1. Broad Market ETFs

Track entire markets:
- **S&P 500** (VOO, SPY, IVV)
- **Total Stock Market** (VTI, ITOT)
- **Total World** (VT, ACWI)

### 2. Sector ETFs

Focus on specific industries:
- Technology (XLK, VGT)
- Healthcare (XLV, VHT)
- Financial (XLF, VFH)
- Energy (XLE, VDE)

### 3. Bond ETFs

Fixed income investments:
- Total Bond Market (BND, AGG)
- Corporate Bonds (LQD)
- Treasury Bonds (TLT, SHY)

### 4. International ETFs

Global exposure:
- Developed Markets (VEA, EFA)
- Emerging Markets (VWO, EEM)
- Specific countries (EWJ for Japan, FXI for China)

### 5. Thematic ETFs

Specific trends:
- Clean Energy (ICLN, QCLN)
- AI & Robotics (BOTZ, ROBO)
- Cybersecurity (HACK, CIBR)

## How to Choose ETFs

### 1. Expense Ratio

**Lower is better.** This annual fee eats into your returns.

| Expense Ratio | $10,000 over 30 years (7% return) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0.03% | $75,387 |
| 0.20% | $71,969 |
| 0.50% | $66,439 |
| 1.00% | $57,435 |

### 2. Assets Under Management (AUM)

Larger funds typically have:
- Better liquidity
- Tighter bid-ask spreads
- Lower closure risk

**Target:** $100 million+ AUM

### 3. Tracking Error

How closely the ETF follows its index. Lower is better.

### 4. Trading Volume

Higher volume = easier to buy/sell at fair prices.

## Building Your First ETF Portfolio

### Simple 3-Fund Portfolio

For most beginners, this is all you need:

| ETF | Allocation | Purpose |
|-----|------------|---------|
| VTI (Total US Stock) | 60% | US equity growth |
| VXUS (International) | 30% | Global diversification |
| BND (Total Bond) | 10% | Stability |

**Adjust bond allocation based on age:** 
- Age 25: 10% bonds
- Age 45: 30% bonds
- Age 65: 50% bonds

### More Aggressive (Young Investors)

| ETF | Allocation |
|-----|------------|
| VTI | 50% |
| VXUS | 30% |
| VGT (Tech) | 15% |
| VWO (Emerging) | 5% |

### More Conservative (Near Retirement)

| ETF | Allocation |
|-----|------------|

## Getting Started: Step by Step

### Step 1: Open a Brokerage Account

Popular options:
- **Fidelity** - No minimums, great research
- **Vanguard** - Pioneer in low-cost investing
- **Charles Schwab** - Excellent customer service
- **Robinhood** - Simple mobile app

### Step 2: Fund Your Account

Start with what you can afford:
- $100 is enough to begin
- Set up automatic monthly contributions
- Consistency beats amount

### Step 3: Buy Your First ETF

1. Search for the ticker (e.g., "VTI")
2. Enter number of shares
3. Choose order type (market or limit)
4. Review and submit

### Step 4: Stay the Course

- Don't check daily
- Ignore market noise
- Rebalance annually
- Keep investing regularly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Overcomplicating

You don't need 20 ETFs. 3-5 is plenty for most investors.

### 2. Chasing Performance

Last year's winner often becomes this year's loser. Stick to your plan.

### 3. Market Timing

Time IN the market beats timing THE market. Stay invested.

### 4. Ignoring Fees

A 1% difference in fees can cost you hundreds of thousands over a lifetime.

### 5. Selling During Crashes

Market drops are when you should BUY more, not sell.

## Tax Considerations

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Prioritize these accounts:
1. **401(k)** - Employer match = free money
2. **Roth IRA** - Tax-free growth
3. **Traditional IRA** - Tax-deferred growth

### Taxable Accounts

For accounts outside retirement:
- Hold ETFs long-term (1+ year) for lower capital gains tax
- Consider tax-loss harvesting
- Index ETFs are tax-efficient

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much money do I need to start?

Most brokers have no minimum. You can start with $100 or even $10 with fractional shares.

### Should I buy ETFs or individual stocks?

For 90% of investors, ETFs are the better choice. Less risk, less research, similar or better returns.

### How often should I invest?

Monthly is ideal. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk.

### When should I sell?

Rarely. Sell only when:
- You need the money
- Your investment thesis changed
- Rebalancing your portfolio

### Are ETFs safe?

ETFs carry market risk, but they're safer than individual stocks due to diversification.
